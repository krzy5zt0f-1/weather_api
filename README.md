### Notes 

The purpose of this repo is to document my first attempts to creat a simple `REACT` that connects to weather API and displays temerature in a chosen city and stores the users choice after a page reload.
This has been achievied by using `localStorage()` option of `JavaScript`.
The API used can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Aditionally, developed app has been test driven using `cypress` in order to make srue to cover all the edge cases, i.e. making sure not to crash the app once non-existent city is being searched for.

To start my testing, I have usued oficial `cypress` documentation that can be found [here](https://www.cypress.io/).
I also have made sure to immerse into usage of `cypress` with the following [artcile](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Add-a-test-file).
